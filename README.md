# Overview
DrawBot controls your mouse to artificially draw images on nearly any game or program.\
It can be quickly configured with with its simple preset system.

This program was inspired by https://github.com/IV2FI/DrawBot.

---

# Usage
**NOTE:** \
While drawing, you can push the **ESCAPE** key to abort the drawing process.

<!-- *You don't want to know how many times I screwed up my computer while developing DrawBot by making my mouse spazzing out. Don't worry, the program is pretty safe now, but I still kept the feature just in case of course.* ðŸ˜‰ -->
